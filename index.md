## About Me

With a passion for creating clear and concise technical documentation
that empowers users, I believe in helping organizations manage and grow
their knowledge capital to enhance their competitive edge.

As a Technical Analyst and Technical Writer at Gradient Zero, I led
initiatives to standardize the company's product, development, and user
documentation while also developing standards for the maintenance and
growth of our internal knowledge base. My experience in collaborating
with cross-functional teams to create documentation that meets both
technical and user needs has resulted in significant improvements to
customer satisfaction and retention.

I hold a Master's in Communication, Culture, and Technology from
Georgetown University, which provided me with a strong foundation in
technical writing, user experience design, and project management. Prior
to attending Georgetown, I served in the United States Army as an
Infantryman, where I developed skills in leadership, problem-solving,
and communication under pressure.

cannot be published, I have included the following sample tutorials to
