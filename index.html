        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>With a passion for creating clear and concise technical documentation that empowers users, I believe in helping organizations manage and grow their knowledge capital to enhance their competitive edge.</p>
        <p>As a Technical Analyst and Technical Writer at Gradient Zero, I led initiatives to standardize the company's product, development, and user documentation while also developing standards for the maintenance and growth of our internal knowledge base. My experience in collaborating with cross-functional teams to create documentation that meets both technical and user needs has resulted in significant improvements to customer satisfaction and retention.</p>
        <p>I hold a Master's in Communication, Culture, and Technology from Georgetown University, which provided me with a strong foundation in technical writing, user experience design, and project management. Prior to attending Georgetown, I served in the United States Army as an Infantryman, where I developed skills in leadership, problem-solving, and communication under pressure.</p>
